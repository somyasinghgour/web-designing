	<p class="c">The <b>Indian Space Research Organisation</b>[a] (ISRO /ˈɪsroʊ/) or (IAST : Bhāratīya Antrikṣ Anusandhān Saṅgaṭhan) is the <b>national space agency</b> of the <b>Republic of India</b>, headquartered in Bengaluru. It operates under<b> Department of Space (DOS)</b> which is directly overseen by the<b> prime minister of India</b> while <b>chairman</b> of ISRO acts as executive of DOS as well. ISRO is the primary agency in India to perform tasks related to space based applications, <b>space exploration </b>and development of related technologies.[6] It is one of six government space agencies in the world which possess full launch capabilities, deploy <b>cryogenic engines</b>, launch <b>extraterrestrial missions</b> and operate large fleets of artificial satellites.[7][b]

    The Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) was established by Jawaharlal Nehru[8] under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in 1962, with the urging of scientist Vikram Sarabhai recognising the need in space research. INCOSPAR grew and became ISRO in 1969,[9] also under the DAE.[10][11] In 1972, the Government of India had set up a Space Commission and the Department of Space (DOS),[12] bringing ISRO under the DOS. The establishment of ISRO thus institutionalised space research activities in India.[13] It is managed by the DOS, which reports to the Prime Minister of India.[14]</p>
